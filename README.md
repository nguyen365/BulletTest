This is meant to be a test engine (by me) for creating shoot them up's. Once completed, I intend it to be boiler plate code if I ever need to make shoot them up's. 
The majority assets are from http://spriters-resource.com/. A more comphensive list of which ones are used for this project are listed below. 
The project is written in Haxe using the HaxeFlixel framework.
